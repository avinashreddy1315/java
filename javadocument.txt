Java is an platform independent

first code is compiled using javac it will generate a file called .class file
which is byte code file.

And then we will be using java and class name to run the byte file in JVM we will
get output.
 
Javac -> Java compiler
JVM -> Java virtual machine
JRE -> Java Runtime Enviroment.
JDK -> Java Development Kit

file runs inside the JRE and JVM is responsible for the running the file.


JDK is like outerbox which is used by developers
Inside the JDK we have JRE -> INSIDE THE JRE we have JVM and libraries.


JAVA is WORA -> WRITE ONCE AND RUN ANY WHERE
